This project integrates with many APIs across the firm and demands high performance to support real-time call scenarios. Our team is using TypeScript and Angular for the frontend, and Node.js, NestJS, and Express for the backend. In my previous project, I developed and optimized endpoints in a RESTful API with Java, Spring, and PostgreSQL. The endpoints I worked on made many database calls and I was able to reduce response time by batching queries and leveraging CompletableFutures for concurrent processing.",

            <p>Hi there!</p>
            <p>
              My name is Aaron. I'm a recent graduate from Northeastern
              University with a B.S. in computer science and math. Currently,
              I'm working full-time as a full-stack engineer at Fidelity
              Investments.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a person, I like to think that I'm naturally driven by
              curiosity and discipline. I find myself always trying to
              understand the why behind things and going down rabbit holes in
              search of an answer. I think this is also the reason why I'm so
              passionate about software engineering. I love discovering new
              technologies and tools, but more importantly, I love actually
              committing to learning them through hands-on practice and real
              application.
            </p>
            <p>
              Below, I showcase some of my relevant professional experience and
              personal projects. For the personal projects, I purposely kept the
              descriptions short. If you want to see the actual project in
              action, please check out the production link. If you want to learn
              more about the development process or the technical details,
              please check out the Github repository where I talk in greater
              depth.
            </p>

              Thanks for visiting my site! Feel free to reach out to any of my
              socials.
